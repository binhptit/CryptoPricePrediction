## To do
- Detect shooting star + hammer + mazubuzu
- Statistic nummber times continue or reversal each candle

## Plan:
1. Crawl crypto currency prices including history and real-time data.
2. Preprocessing, data annotation
3. Model building. 
    * 3.1 Price open, close, high, low prediction (1h, 4h, 1d) 
        * 3.1.1 LSTM
        * 3.1.2 Attention + LSTM 
        * 3.1.3 Attention + bi-LSTM
        * 3.1.4 Bert based model 
    * 3.2 Price action candle setup Prediction
3. Evaluation
